# 50DaysOfUdacity

A challenge to foster a habit of consistent learning and community engagement/support.

## What is the #50DaysofUdacity Challenge?

You may have heard of the #100DaysofCode Challenge, the the 50 Days of Udacity Challenge is similar. **The premise of this challenge is to build a habit of consistent practice of new skills by making a public commitment of practicing the topics of your Foundation Course every day for 50 days.**

**Why?** Because habits that emphasise consistent practice have been proven to help overall retention of new learning material.

This **repo/template** was created to make it easy to keep track of your progress during the challenge, and to add a visiual effect to your progess and commitment by updating your GitHub contribution chart daily (**extra motivation!**).
